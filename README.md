# Interactive COVID-19 India Dashboard

<strong>_WARNING_: The scale of the spread has meant that the individual data is no longer relevant or useful. This visualization has been removed to reduce any confusion. See the [main dashboard](https://covid19india.org) for up to date information.</strong>

The dashboard was made using [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) which brings [crossfilter](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter) and [d3](https://d3js.org/) together to be able to filter the visualisation on the fly by interacting with the charts. The data comes from the [API](https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/unofficial/covid19india.org) made by the good folks at [covid19india.org](https://www.covid19india.org/).
